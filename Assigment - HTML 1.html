	<h3> My hobbies </h3>

	<p>I have a lot of hobbies, but I could not do most of them  due to the lack of time or I focus too much on only to one, so here are some hobbies that I usually do.</p>
	<p>Here are the top three hobbies that I usually do, one of the hobbies that I mostly do is playing games. The type of games that I play the most are Role Playing Games, Card Games, </p>
	<p>MOBA, etc. I usually play this games due to its competitive environment, graphics, and lore. Some examples of these games are Genshin Impact, Legends of Runeterra </p>
	<p>and Wildrift. The second hobby that I do is reading mangas and manhwas. I prefer reading stories that have drawings since it can help me imagine on what is happening </p>
	<p>I'm also fascinated to the artist that draw since they're drawing are very incredible and detailed like the drawings in the manga of One Punch Man. The third hobby that I do is </p>
	<p>watching. The genres that I like most are the slice of life, Fantasy, Actions, and many other things, while the movies that I usually watch are American movies like John Wick,</p>
	<p>for the cartoons is mostly disney and warner bros, for the anime like Gintama, Yozakura Family, and Rezero.</p>

	<br> </br>

	<p>Now that I have discussed my top three hobbies, let's discuss the three hobbies that I rarely do, but I still enjoy. First one is Traditional Drawing, I think the last time I draw </p>
	<p>was back on I was in Grade 12 which was 2022-2023, and I haven't drawn since then due to the lack of time, and materials, but I do miss it. The things that I usually draw are just 2D </p>
	<p>that are base on the anime that I have watch or I'll search for some reference that matches the mood that I had that time. The second one is also drawing but in a digital format, what I </p>
	<p>usually do was, I would take a picture of the traditional drawing that I have made, then I would trace it and color it to through digital since I was too afraid of coloring my tradtional </p>
	<p>thinking I might mess it up. The third one is Crochet, I tried Crochet due to my elder sister buying tools for it, it was very enjoyable but it also needs a lot of time and effort, so I </p>
	<p>could'nt pay too much attention to it, so I eventually stopped doing it for as long as I can remember </p>
